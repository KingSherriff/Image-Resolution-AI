# Image-Resolution-AI


Basic Pipeline Process:

The main objective for the pipeline is to create a bit of code that will automatically take a selected folder of images and provide us points of comparison both visually and data wise. Perhaps we will scratch off most of the visual comparison later on.

At this point the automation of the downscaling and then upscaling for a lower quality image has been complete. The next immediate task would be more clearly showing a sort of loss in image fidelity. By doing this, we will have tangible comparisons to make with our future tests. This will make things much easier going forward. The measuring of loss will likely change and have other forms of measurement added on as the project goes along, but for now a simple start is good.

I will thus be taking a short while to research examples of how others measured loss in fidelity and image quality with the hope of finding a sort of standard methodology that may act as a jumping off point.
